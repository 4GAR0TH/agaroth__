I’m Agaroth, a guy determined to give everything he has to become better at cyber security.
The two areas that interest me most are reverse engineering and the web.
In this blog I intend to share my progress, my failures as my successes my short, medium and long term goals.
I don’t pretend to be an expert just someone who has his way of working and challenging himself. 
To be honest I want to keep this blog for you as for me, 
not to procrastinate and improve my discipline by announcing what I intend to do and doing it.
In any case, if you have read so far thank you, take care of yourself and have a good day.
STRENGTH AND HONOR
